      faqs: [
        {
          question: "How do I report a scam?",
          answer: "Navigate to the 'Report Scam' page and fill out the submission form. Provide as much detail as possible including the wallet/contract address, blockchain network, type of scam, and any evidence you have. The more information you provide, the faster we can verify and process your report."
        },

          question: "What types of scams can I report?",
          answer: "You can report various types of blockchain-related fraud including rug pulls, phishing attempts, fake tokens, Ponzi schemes, honeypot contracts, impersonation scams, and any other fraudulent activities in the Web3 space."
        },
        {
          question: "What happens after I submit a report?",
          answer: "Once submitted, your report enters our verification queue. Our team reviews each submission, cross-references with other reports and on-chain data, and assigns a status. Reports may be marked as 'Pending', 'Investigating', or 'Verified' based on our findings."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I submit anonymous reports?",
          answer: "Yes, you can submit reports without creating an account. However, creating an account allows you to track your submissions, receive updates on your reports, and build credibility within the community."
        },
        {
          question: "What evidence should I include in my report?",
          answer: "Include transaction hashes, screenshots of interactions, links to fraudulent websites or social media profiles, smart contract addresses, and any communication with the scammer. The more evidence you provide, the stronger your report becomes."

      icon: Shield,
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "How do you verify reports?",
          answer: "We use a multi-layered verification process that includes on-chain analysis, cross-referencing with known scam patterns, community voting, and manual review by our expert team. Reports with multiple independent submissions receive higher priority."
        },
        {
          question: "What do the different report statuses mean?",
          answer: "'Pending' means the report is awaiting review. 'Investigating' indicates our team is actively analyzing the case. 'Verified' confirms the report has been validated through our verification process. 'Disputed' means conflicting information has been received."
        },
        {
          question: "Can a verified scammer appeal their listing?",
          answer: "Yes, we have an appeals process for cases where new evidence emerges. However, the burden of proof lies with the appellant, and all appeals are thoroughly investigated before any changes are made to a listing."
        },
        {
          question: "How do you prevent false reports?",
          answer: "We implement several safeguards including requiring detailed evidence, cross-referencing reports, analyzing reporter credibility, and conducting independent investigations. Malicious reporters may be banned from the platform."
